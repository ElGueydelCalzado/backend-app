# Upload to Private Repository

## Issue Identified ✅
The repository `ElGueydelCalzado/backend-app` is **private**, which requires proper authentication to push code.

## Solution: Personal Access Token

### Step 1: Create Personal Access Token

1. **Go to**: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. **Click**: "Generate new token" → "Generate new token (classic)"
3. **Token details**:
   - **Note**: `EGDC Upload Token`
   - **Expiration**: 90 days (or as needed)
   - **Scopes**: Select these checkboxes:
     - ✅ `repo` (Full control of private repositories)
     - ✅ `workflow` (Update GitHub Action workflows)
     - ✅ `write:packages` (Upload packages)

4. **Generate token** and **copy it immediately** (you won't see it again)

### Step 2: Upload Your Code

Once you have the token, run:

```bash
cd /Users/kadokk/CursorAI/EGDC
./push-with-token.sh YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
```

**Example**:
```bash
./push-with-token.sh ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

### Step 3: Verify Upload

After successful upload, check:
- **Repository**: https://github.com/ElGueydelCalzado/backend-app
- **Branches**: Should see `main` and `development`
- **Files**: Should see all 109 files

## Alternative: Make Repository Public

If you prefer, you can:
1. Go to repository **Settings**
2. Scroll to **Danger Zone**
3. Click **Change repository visibility**
4. Make it **Public**

Then try the regular push:

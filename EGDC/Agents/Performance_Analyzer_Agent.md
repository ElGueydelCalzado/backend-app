## **Specific Performance Patterns to Identify**

### **üîç Database Performance Anti-Patterns**
```sql
-- ‚ùå N+1 Query Problem
SELECT * FROM products;
-- Then for each product:
SELECT * FROM categories WHERE id = product.category_id;

-- ‚úÖ Optimized with JOIN
SELECT p.*, c.name as category_name 
FROM products p 
JOIN categories c ON p.category_id = c.id;
```

### **‚öõÔ∏è React Performance Anti-Patterns**
```typescript
// ‚ùå Unnecessary re-renders
function ProductList({ products }) {
  return (
    <div>
      {products.map(product => (
        <ProductCard 
          key={product.id} 
          product={product} 
          onUpdate={() => updateProduct(product)} // New function every render!
        />
      ))}
    </div>
  )
}

// ‚úÖ Optimized with useCallback
function ProductList({ products }) {
  const handleUpdate = useCallback((product) => {
    updateProduct(product)
  }, [])

  return (
    <div>
      {products.map(product => (
        <ProductCard 
          key={product.id} 
          product={product} 
          onUpdate={handleUpdate}
        />
      ))}
    </div>
  )
}
```

### **üåê API Performance Anti-Patterns**
```typescript
// ‚ùå Over-fetching data
export async function GET() {
  const products = await db.query(`
    SELECT * FROM products 
    JOIN categories ON products.category_id = categories.id
    JOIN warehouses ON products.warehouse_id = warehouses.id
  `) // Returns massive payload
  
  return Response.json({ products })
}

// ‚úÖ Optimized with field selection
export async function GET(request) {
  const { searchParams } = new URL(request.url)
  const fields = searchParams.get('fields') || 'id,name,price'
  
  const products = await db.query(`
    SELECT ${fields} FROM products 
    WHERE status = 'active'
    LIMIT 50
  `)
  
  return Response.json({ products })
}
```

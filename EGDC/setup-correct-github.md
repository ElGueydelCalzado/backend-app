# Setup Correct GitHub Repository

## Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub

1. **Login to GitHub** as `ElGueydelCalzado`
2. **Go to**: https://github.com/new
3. **Repository details**:
   - **Repository name**: `backend-app`
   - **Description**: `EGDC Inventory Management System - Backend Application`
   - **Visibility**: Public (or Private as preferred)
   - **Initialize**: Leave unchecked (we have existing code)

4. **Click "Create repository"**

## Step 2: Push Code to Correct Repository

Once the repository is created, run these commands:

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd /Users/kadokk/CursorAI/EGDC

# Verify remote is set correctly
git remote -v

# Push main branch
git push -u origin main

# Push development branch
git push -u origin development

# Verify both branches are pushed
git branch -r
```

## Step 3: Verify Upload

Check that all your code is now visible at:
https://github.com/ElGueydelCalzado/backend-app
